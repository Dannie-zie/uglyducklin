<p>Once upon a time down on an old farm, lived a duck 
  family, and Mother Duck had been sitting on a 
  clutch of new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs
  hatched and out popped six chirpy ducklings. 
  But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it 
  didn't hatch. Mother Duck couldn't recall laying 
  that seventh egg. How did it get there? TOCK! TOCK!
  The little prisoner was pecking inside his shell
</p>
<p>"Did I count the eggs wrongly?" Mother Duck wondered. 
  But before she had time to think about it, the 
  last egg finally hatched. A strange looking 
  duckling with gray feathers that should have 
  been yellow gazed at a worried mother. The 
  ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck had a 
  secret worry.
</p>
<p>"I can't understand how this ugly duckling can be one 
  of mine!" she said to herself, shaking her head as 
  she looked at her last born. Well, the gray 
  duckling certainly wasn't pretty, and since he ate 
  far more than his brothers, he was outgrowing them. 
  As the days went by, the poor ugly duckling became 
  more and more unhappy. His brothers didn't want to
  play with him, he was so clumsy, and all the 
  farmyard folks simply laughed at him. He felt 
  sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to 
  console him.
</p>
<p>"Poor little ugly duckling!" she would say. "Why 
  are you so different from the others?" And the 
  ugly duckling felt worse than ever. He secretly
  wept at night. He felt nobody wanted him.
</p>
<p>"Nobody loves me, they all tease me! Why am I 
  different from my brothers?"
</p>
<p>Then one day, at sunrise, he ran away from the 
  farmyard. He stopped at a pond and began to 
  question all the other birds. "Do you know of 
  any ducklings with gray feathers like mine?" 
  But everyone shook their heads in scorn.
</p>
<p>"We don't know anyone as ugly as you." The ugly 
  duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept 
  on making inquiries. He went to another pond, 
  where a pair of large geese gave him the same 
  answer to his question. What's more, they warned 
  him: "Don't stay here! Go away! It's dangerous.
  There are men with guns around here!" The duckling
  was sorry he had ever left the farmyard.
</p>
<p>Then one day, his travels took him near an old 
  countrywoman's cottage. Thinking he was a stray 
  goose, she caught him.
</p>
<p>"I'll put this in a hutch. I hope it's a female
  and lays plenty of eggs!" said the old woman, whose
  eyesight was poor. But the ugly duckling laid not a 
  single egg. The hen kept frightening him.
</p>
<p>"Just wait! If you don't lay eggs, the old woman 
  will wring your neck and pop you into the pot!" And
  the cat chipped in: "Hee! Hee! I hope the woman 
  cooks you, then I can gnaw at your bones!" The 
  poor ugly duckling was so scared that he lost his 
  appetite, though the old woman kept stuffing him 
  with food and grumbling: "If you won't lay eggs, 
  at least hurry up and get plump!"
</p>
<p>"Oh, dear me!" moaned the now terrified duckling.
  "I'll die of fright first! And I did so hope 
  someone would love me!"
</p>
<p>Then one night, finding the hutch door ajar, he
  escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as 
  far away as he could, and at dawn, he found 
  himself in a thick bed of reeds. "If nobody 
  wants me, I'll hid here forever." There was 
  plenty a food, and the duckling began to feel 
  a little happier, though he was lonely. One day 
  at sunrise, he saw a flight of beautiful birds 
  wing overhead. White, with long slender necks, 
  yellow beaks and large wings, they were migrating
  south.
</p>
<p>"If only I could look like them, just for a day!"
  said the duckling, admiringly. Winter came and the 
  water in the reed bed froze. The poor duckling 
  left home to seek food in the snow. He dropped 
  exhausted to the ground, but a farmer found him 
  and put him in his big jacket pocket.
</p>
<p>"I'll take him home to my children. They'll look 
  after him. Poor thing, he's frozen!" The duckling 
  was showered with kindly care at the farmer's house.
  In this way, the ugly duckling was able to survive
  the bitterly cold winter
</p>
<p>However, by springtime, he had grown so big that 
  the farmer decided: "I'll set him free by the 
  pond!" That was when the duckling saw himself
  mirrored in the water.
</p>
<p>"Goodness! How I've changed! I hardly recognize 
  myself!" The flight of swans winged north again 
  and glided on to the pond. When the duckling saw 
  them, he realized he was one of their kind, and 
  soon made friends.
</p>
<p>"We're swans like you!" they said, warmly. "Where
  have you been hiding?"
</p>
<p>"It's a long story," replied the young swan, 
  still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with 
  his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on 
  the river bank exclaim: "Look at that young swan! 
  He's the finest of them all!"
</p>
<p>And he almost burst with happiness.</p>
